# Weio firmware

This is the next firmware version for WeIO, based on [RIOT-OS](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT).

## How to build the firmware

First, RIOT-OS must be installed on your system :

git clone https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT
```
```RIOTBASE``` must also be set to point in the correct RIOT path.

To build the firmware, run ```make```.
